I am an Industrious college student with work experience in the IT field. I will be graduating from UW-Stout with an Applied Mathematics and Computer Science Degree in May 2020. I am a practicing software developer aiming to achieve relevant internship or work experience before graduating.

I work well with little to no supervision and I always meet deadlines. I consider myself a responsible individual and I consistently go out of my way to continually improve the quality of my work. I coordinate with other members of my team and not only arrive at workable solutions to their technology problems, but also implement them in a timely fashion. If I spot any repetitive tasks, I work to automate them as soon as possible.

Learning new skills is a passion of mine. I regularly try to stay up to date with developing technology. I am also driven to analyze the technology I use. For example, I have re-programed libraries and small frameworks to learn how they operate and I often browse the code of open-source projects to learn as much as I can from experts in my field.

Some relevant skills and tools that I have experience using:

<code>
C++ | Java | JavaScript | HTML5 | CSS3 | Linux Server | Web Development | Version Control | Git | Markdown | Image Editing | Word Processing | Spreadsheets | Computer Hardware Assembly
