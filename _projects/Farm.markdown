This is a website I made for my family farm.

All css was done from scratch (excluding normalize.css). The site is being hosted by GitHub Pages.
Pages are beign cached and distributed through CloudFlare. Jekyll static site generator is used to generate the site from a combination of html and markdown files.

Javascript was avoided intentionally.
I prefer to avoid added complexity when the website being made is trivial.
