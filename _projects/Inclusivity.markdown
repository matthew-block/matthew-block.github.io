I created the Torward One Wisconsin conference website over 2 months while employed at the
[Wisconsin Institute for Public Policy and Service](https://wipps.org/).

The site is being hosted on DigitalOcean on a standard LAMP stack. Drupal is being used as the CMS, with the plugin Drupal Commerce serving as the only method to
purchase tickets for the conference. Various other plugins are utilized to enable receipt emails, general form collection, and more.

While developing the site, I used Git version contron, and Docker containers for local hosting. The front-end of the site was made with Bootstrap 3 for better cross-browser compatability.
